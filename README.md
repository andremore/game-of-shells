# Game of Santas ðŸŽ…

## Why Vanilla TypeScript?

For this project, I intentionally avoided using any frontend frameworks to focus on core web development skills. By using Vanilla TypeScript, I aimed to:

- Gain a deeper understanding of TypeScript in a browser environment.
- Show the ability to build a project from scratch without pre-built abstractions.
- Challenge myself to manage DOM interactions, state management, and application logic directly.
